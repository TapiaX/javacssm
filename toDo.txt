Goals of this compiler (+reached, *recent, -remaining, #consequence)
	+type analisis (attributes, variables, methods, conditions)
	+instructions, conditional and condicional loop
	+expressions with operators precedence 
	+reference to atributes (global variables)
	+local scope for each instructions block (includes conditions)
	    #shadowing global variables
	    *only if contains declared variables 
	+reference to local variables 
	+declaration of local variable (instruction)
	+asignement of atributes and variables (instruccion)
	+main method (non-static) 
	+call to a method in instruction 
		# supports recursive methods
	+parameters (passing parameters)
		+number and type of local parameters (expressions) must match with formals parameters 
	+return instruction (method result)
	    + call to a method in expression
	   		# result can be used in asignement, condition or in local parameter  
	   	*returning from any block of instructions within a method (includes nested blocks)
	*restriction of void type for atributes and variables 
		#restriction of void type method in asignement
	*restriction of void type in parameters (formals)
		#too for actual parameteters
	*restriction method with void type must have no return
	*restriction methodo with type different from void must have a return
		*for each execution path
		*return must be the last instruction of a block
			#instruction after return is unreacheable (it never executes)


Detected Errors of language detected by this compiler 
 Sintax errors
 	from Scanner  
	+Invalid character 
 	from Parser   
 	+invalid program sintax
 Semantic errors
    from AnalisisContexto 
    +variable not declarated (in either local or global scope)
	+variable declared twice (in same or previous local scope) 
	+incompatible type for variable (in same or previous local scope) 
	+incorrect type of expression (in asignement, parameter, condition)
	*only methods can be of void type
	+method is not found
	+number of parameters doesn't match (too much or too few)
	+type of parameter doesn't match
	+type of return is different than the expected one for method
	+method doesn't expect any return
	*missing return for method
	*instruction unreachable 
 Logical errors 
        out of scope

Asserts about the return instruction
some return = exist a return
missing return = there is one or more missing returns in an execution path (more instruccions are admited)
unreachable = some return and no missing return
void method = method have void type
invalid return = void method and some return

always missing return in conditional loop(while)
mising return in conditional (if) if missing return in any of its blocks
